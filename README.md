### Continued development

Hmm ðŸ¤” ...

Specific areas that the solution should be improved:

- JavaScript code refactoring - Ugh! I feel like I didn't really [hit the mark on this one](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/javascript-fundamentals-oR7g6-mTZ-/steps/66d097b43c19191dc323ec1d/article/read). Especially keeping my code DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself), using objects to simplify logic, and favouring pure functions. There's more to do on this front, for sure.
- Vertical centering of the main container at the larger viewport widths, but with a smaller viewport height.
- Make sure the "Custom" label is entirely visible.
- Make sure the results labels and inputs are visible even for small viewport/container widths. Possibly move them to a vertical stack at smaller container widths. A similar challenge arises for the error messages, which should probably also be stacked vertically underneath the input labels (or possibly even underneath the input fields) at smaller container widths.

More general ideas I want to consider:

- [A (more) Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/)
- [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) - Incorporate all of the [https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/](patterns) and [practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/) associated with ARIA. Such as the [radio buttons pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/) and the [Radio Group Example Using Roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/examples/radio/)

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Went here a lot to reference the different CSS properties and the shorthands, and all the great explanations about best practices.
- [MDN Guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) - So many resources and nice explanations, including stuff [tutorials specific to Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) - My go to source for thinking about layouts now.
- [The Clamp Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - Used for all of fluid typography and fluid spacing calculations.
